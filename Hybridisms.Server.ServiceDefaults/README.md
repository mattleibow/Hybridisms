# Hybridisms.Server.ServiceDefaults

This project demonstrates how to configure backend services to support hybrid applications, with service discovery, health monitoring, and telemetry solutions that work consistently across both web and native client scenarios.

## Hybrid Techniques Demonstrated
- **Hybrid-Ready Service Registration**: Configures server endpoints to be discoverable by both web and native clients
- **Health Monitoring**: Enables clients across platforms to check service health
- **Cross-Platform Telemetry**: Configures observability that works for the entire hybrid app ecosystem

## Key Hybrid Features
- **Hybrid-Ready Service Registration**: Extensions to make services work with both web and native clients:
  ```csharp
  public static WebApplicationBuilder AddServiceDefaults(this WebApplicationBuilder builder)
  {
      // Configure services for all client types (web and native)
      builder.Services.AddServiceDiscovery();
      
      // Health checks accessible from any platform
      builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
          .AddCheck("self", () => HealthCheckResult.Healthy());
      
      // Cross-platform telemetry
      builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
          .WithTracing(tracing => {
              // Collect telemetry from both web and native clients
          });
      
      return builder;
  }
  ```

- **Platform-Agnostic Endpoints**: Configures service endpoints to be accessible from any client type
- **Comprehensive Health Monitoring**: Enables clients to verify service health before operations

## How the Hybrid Server Configuration Works
- **Universal Endpoint Configuration**: Ensures all server endpoints are accessible from any client platform
- **Consistent Service Discovery**: Enables service location for both web and native clients
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Available to all clients to determine service status
- **Unified Telemetry**: Traces interactions across web and native client boundaries

## Implementing This Pattern in Your Hybrid Apps
1. Configure server endpoints with platform-agnostic discovery
2. Implement comprehensive health checks visible to all client types
3. Set up telemetry that can track operations across platform boundaries
4. Use consistent service configuration that works for both web and native clients
