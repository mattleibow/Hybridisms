# Hybridisms.Client.WebAssembly.ClientStub

## Overview
This is a stub project used for Aspire orchestration and service discovery in hybrid scenarios. It enables Aspire to manage and launch the Blazor WebAssembly client as part of the distributed hybrid app.

## What the Project Does
- Acts as a placeholder for the WASM client in Aspire-based orchestration.
- Enables service discovery and configuration for the WASM app.
- Does not contain application logic; used for deployment and configuration only.

## Implementation Architecture
- **Stub Project**: Contains minimal code and references for Aspire orchestration.
- **Service Discovery**: Integrates with Aspire and service defaults for hybrid scenarios.

## Hybrid App Enablement
- **Orchestration**: Allows the WASM client to be managed as part of the distributed hybrid solution.
- **Service Discovery**: Ensures the WASM client can discover and connect to backend services.

## Example: Stub Project Reference
```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\..\Hybridisms.Client.WebAssembly\Hybridisms.Client.WebAssembly.csproj" />
```

## Summary
Hybridisms.Client.WebAssembly.ClientStub is essential for orchestrating and configuring the WASM client in hybrid Aspire deployments.
